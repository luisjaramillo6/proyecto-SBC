We sought to study the effect of shelter-in-place orders on emergent operative upper-extremity surgery.\n\nMethods\nAll patients undergoing emergent and time-sensitive operations to the finger(s), hand, wrist, and forearm were tracked over an equal number of days before and after shelter-in-place orders at 2 geographically distinct Level I trauma centers. Surgical volume and resources, patient demographics, and injury patterns were compared before and after official shelter-in-place orders.\n\nResults\nA total of 58 patients underwent time-sensitive or emergent operations. Mean patient age was 42 years; mean injury severity score was 9 and median American Society of Anesthesiologist score was 2. There was a 40% increase in volume after shelter-in-place orders, averaging 1.4 cases/d. Indications for surgery included high-energy closed fracture (60%), traumatic nerve injury (19%), severe soft tissue infection (15%), and revascularization of the arm, hand, or digit(s) (15%). High-risk behavior, defined as lawlessness, assault, and high-speed auto accidents, was associated with a significantly greater proportion of operations after shelter-in-place orders (40% vs 12.5%; P < .05). Each institution dedicated an average of 3 inpatient beds and one intensive care unit–capable bed to upper-extremity care daily. Resources used included an average of 115 minutes of daily operating room time and 8 operating room staff or personnel per case.\n\nConclusions\nHand and upper-extremity operative volume increased after shelter-in-place orders at 2 major Level I trauma centers across the country, demanding considerable hospital resources. The rise in volume was associated with an increase in high-risk behavior.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589514120300487'),(3,'Science Direct','EN','Oligosymptomatic Kidney Transplant Patients With COVID-19: Do They Pose a Risk to Other Recipients','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.05.028','2020','The clinical course of viral infections in patients under immunosuppression can be atypical and/or fatal if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may also have an atypical presentation. Contrary to the general opinion, transplant patients may be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic, which could be a risk factor for underdiagnosis and the dissemination of this viral disease.\n\nThis study presents the clinical features of 2 oligosymptomatic kidney transplant patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We suggest that new screening algorithms for COVID-19 should be reconsidered for the transplant patient population.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been identified as the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1,2]. The clinical course of the disease is usually characterized by fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea; however, in some cases, the disease can progress to severe viral pneumonia and respiratory failure, necessitating intubation [1,3,4].\n\nIt is well-known that viral infections may cause atypical symptoms and signs in transplant patients because of chronic immunosuppression.

Even if the efficacy of this combination is under evaluation, clinicians have begun to use it largely. As these medications are known to prolong QT interval, we analyzed serial electrocardiograms (ECG) performed in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with HCQ + AZ.\n\n50 consecutive patients received the combination of HCQ (600mg/d for 10 days) and AZ (500mg Day 1 and 250mg daily days 2 to 5). Twelve-lead ECG were performed before treatment, at Day 3, 5 and at discharge. Median age of patients was 68 years, 55.2% were males. Main comorbidities were hypertension (37%) and diabetes (17%). Mean QTc was 408 ms at baseline and rose up to 437 ms at Day 3 and to 456 ms at Day 5. 38 patients (76 %) presented short term modifications of QTc (> 30 ms). Treatment discontinuation was decided in 6 patients (12%) leading to QTc normalization in 5 of them. No death, no cardiac arrhythmic event were observed in this cohort.\n\nOur report confirms that a short duration treatment with HCQ + AZ modifies QTc interval. Treatment has to be stopped for QTc modifications in 12% of patients. Nevertheless, in inpatients hospitalized for COVID-19, we did not observe any clinically relevant consequence of these transitory modifications. In conclusion, when patients are treated with HCQ+AZ, cardiac monitoring should be regularly performed and hospital settings allow to do it in safe conditions.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620304754'),(6,'Science Direct','EN','Addressing a National Crisis: The Spine Hospital and Department\'s Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in New York City','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2020.05.539','2020','In a very brief period, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept across the planet leaving governments, societies and healthcare systems unprepared and under-resourced.

Until now, there has been no evidence for detection of airborne severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and this may have implication for the potential spread of the COVID-19. We investigated the air of patient rooms with confirmed COVID-19 in the largest hospital in Iran, on March 17, 2020. To collect the SARS-CoV-2 particles, ten air samples were collected into the sterile standard midget impingers containing 20 mL DMEM with 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin and 1% antifoam reagent for 1 h. Besides, indoor particle number concentrations, CO2, relative humidity and temperature were recorded throughout the sampling duration. Viral RNA was extracted from samples taken from the impingers and Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was applied to confirm the positivity of collected samples based on the virus genome sequence. Fortunately, in this study all air samples which were collected 2 to 5 m from the patients\' beds with confirmed COVID-19 were negative.

Empirical models are useful tools to predict future trends of disease progression such as COVID-19 over the near-term. A modified Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (m-IDEA) model was developed to predict the progression of infectious disease outbreaks. The modification allows for the production of precise daily estimates, which are critical during a pandemic of this scale for planning purposes. The m-IDEA model was employed using a range of serial intervals given the lack of knowledge on the true serial interval of COVID-19. Both deterministic and stochastic approaches were applied. Model fitting was accomplished through minimizing the sum-of-square differences between predicted and observed daily incidence case counts, and performance was retrospectively assessed. The performance of the m-IDEA for projection cases in the near-term was improved using shorter serial intervals (1–4 days) at early stages of the pandemic, and longer serial intervals at mid- to late-stages (5–9 days) thus far. This, coupled with epidemiological reports, suggests that the serial interval of COVID-19 might increase as the pandemic progresses, which is rather intuitive: Increasing serial intervals can be attributed to gradual increases in public health interventions such as facility closures, public caution and social distancing, thus increasing the time between transmission events. In most cases, the stochastic approach captured the majority of future reported incidence data, because it accounts for the uncertainty around the serial interval of COVID-19. As such, it is the preferred approach for using the m-IDEA during dynamic situation such as in the midst of a major pandemic.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042720300166'),(25,'Science Direct','EN','Anticipating and Mitigating theImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemicon Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.04.010','2020','The COVID-19 pandemic is causing global morbidity and mortality, straining health systems, and disrupting society, putting individuals with Alzheimer\'s disease and related dementias (ADRD) at risk of significant harm.

Shortly after that, it was reported that mortality rates in New York City (NYC), the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in black and Hispanic populations.\n\nObjectives\nThe aim of this article is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as they relate to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation.\n\nSetting\nNYC.\n\nMethods\nCOVID-19 data were obtained from the official New York authorities in relation to total number of cases in the different boroughs of NYC. Age-adjusted COVID-19–related mortality rates of the different ethnic groups were also obtained. These data were cross-compared with historic community health data on obesity rates previously published and also obesity rates among the different ethnic groups in NYC.\n\nResults\nThe 2 NYC boroughs that have the highest mortality rates are the Bronx (6%) and Brooklyn (5.4%). Both the Bronx and Brooklyn were also found to have the highest obesity rates at 32% and 27%, respectively. The 2 ethnic groups with the highest obesity rates (Hispanic and black) were also found to have the highest age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 compared with the other ethnic groups (22.8% and 19.8%, respectively).\n\nConclusions\nThe Hispanic and black populations in NYC seem to be disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because of the higher incidence of mortality rates.

Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nFrench mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300646'),(42,'Science Direct','ES','ATENCION DE LA URGENCIA QUIRURGICA DURANTE LA\r\nPANDEMIA COVID-19.

The results of the first clinical studies evaluating the effect of hydroxychloroquine do not support any efficacy of this drug in patients with COVID-19, due to major methodological weaknesses. Yet, these preliminary studies have aroused considerable media interest, raising fears of massive and uncontrolled use. In the absence of evidence of clinical benefits, the main risk is of exposing patients unnecessarily to the well-known adverse effects of hydroxychloroquine, with a possibly increased risk in the specific setting of COVID-19. In addition, widespread use outside of any recommendation risks compromising the completion of good quality clinical trials. The chloroquine hype, fueled by low-quality studies and media announcements, has yielded to the implementation of more than 150 studies worldwide. This represents a waste of resources and a loss of opportunity for other drugs to be properly evaluated. In the context of emergency, rigorous trials are more than ever needed in order to have, as soon as possible, reliable data on drugs that are possibly effective against the disease.

There were 3 fatalities due to respiratory failure, whereas 4 severe and 4 mild cases recovered and were discharged. All patients had once experienced leukocytosis and eosinopenia. Remittent fever and resected lung segments =5 were associated with fatality.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThe case fatality rate of postsurgical patients subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19 was 27.3%. Insidious symptom onset, postoperative leukocytosis with lymphopenia, and postsurgical CT changes overshadowed the early signs of viral pneumonia. Dynamic symptom monitoring, serial chest CTs, and tests for viral RNA and serum antibody improve the chance for prompt detection of COVID-19. Consideration should be given to preadmission and preoperative screening and strict contact isolation during the postoperative period.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002252232030859X'),(64,'Science Direct','EN','Clinical course of severe and critical COVID-19 in hospitalized pregnancies: a US\r\ncohort study','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100134','2020','Background\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on healthcare systems around the world with 3.0 million infected and 208,000 resultant mortalities as of this writing.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other viral upper respiratory illnesses. Three major trajectories include mild disease with upper respiratory symptoms, non-severe pneumonia, and severe pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Emergency physicians should focus on identifying patients at risk, isolating suspected patients, and informing hospital infection prevention and public health authorities. Patients with suspected COVID-19 should be asked to wear a facemask. Respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and personal protective equipment are recommended for all healthcare personnel caring for suspected cases. Disposition depends on patient symptoms, hemodynamic status, and patient ability to self-quarantine.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThis narrative review provides clinicians with an updated approach to the evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected COVID-19.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720301789'),(86,'Science Direct','ES','Coronavirus: la emergencia geriátrica de 2020.

A quantitative analysis of suspended matter patterns, based on satellite-derived turbidity, in the absence of traffic perturbations, allowed to focus on natural processes and the residual stress from human activities that continued throughout the lockdown. We conclude that the high water transparency can be considered as a transient condition determined by a combination of natural seasonal factors and the effects of COVID-19 restrictions.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720331326'),(108,'Science Direct','EN','COVID-19 pneumonia manifestations at the admission on chest ultrasound, radiographs, and CT: single-center study and comprehensive radiologic literature review','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100231','2020','Purpose\r\nTo investigate the imaging features of emerging COVID-19 pneumonia on chest ultrasound (US), radiographs (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) examinations performed at admission and to provide a comprehensive radiological literature review on ongoing radiological data from recent publications.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods\r\nIn this retrospective single-center study, we enrolled consecutive patients from February 15, 2020, to March 15, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized in Valduce Hospital (Como, Italy).

We aim to model the impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing into resuming endoscopy practice.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nWe performed a retrospective review of endoscopy utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic for a baseline reference. A computer model compared 3 approaches: strategy 1, endoscopy for urgent indications only; strategy 2, testing for semiurgent indications; and strategy 3, testing all patients. Analysis was made under current COVID-19 prevalence and projected prevalence of 5% and 10%. Primary outcomes were number of procedures performed and/or canceled. Secondary outcomes were direct costs, reimbursement, personal protective equipment used, and personnel infected. Disease prevalence, testing accuracy, and costs were obtained from the literature.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, endoscopy volume was 12.7% of expected. Strategies 2 and 3 were safe and effective interventions to resume endoscopy in semiurgent and elective cases. Investing 22 U.S. dollars (USD) and 105 USD in testing per patient allowed the completion of 19.4% and 95.3% of baseline endoscopies, respectively. False-negative results were seen after testing 4700 patients (or 3 months of applying strategy 2 in our practice). Implementing PCR testing over 1 week in the United States would require 13 and 64 million USD, with a return of 165 and 767 million USD to providers, leaving 65 and 325 healthcare workers infected.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nPCR testing is an effective strategy to restart endoscopic practice in the United States. PCR screening should be implemented during the second phase of the pandemic, once the healthcare system is able to test and isolate all suspected COVID-19 cases.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016510720342486'),(110,'Science Direct','EN','COVID-19\'s impact on the atmospheric environment in the Southeast Asia region','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139658','2020','Since its first appearance in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019, the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved a global pandemic within three months, with more than 4.3 million confirmed cases worldwide until mid-May 2020. As many countries around the world, Malaysia and other southeast Asian (SEA) countries have also enforced lockdown at different degrees to contain the spread of the disease, which has brought some positive effects on natural environment. Therefore, evaluating the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and the related governmental measures to restrict its expansion is crucial to assess its impacts on air pollution and economic growth. In this study, we used aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from Himawari-8 satellite, along with tropospheric NO2 column density from Aura-OMI over SEA, and ground-based pollution measurements at several stations across Malaysia, in order to quantify the changes in aerosol and air pollutants associated with the general shutdown of anthropogenic and industrial activities due to COVID-19. The lockdown has led to a notable decrease in AOD over SEA and in the pollution outflow over the oceanic regions, while a significant decrease (27% - 30%) in tropospheric NO2 was observed over areas not affected by seasonal biomass burning. Especially in Malaysia, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations have been decreased by 26–31%, 23–32%, 63–64%, 9–20%, and 25–31%, respectively, in the urban areas during the lockdown phase, compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Notable reductions are also seen at industrial, suburban and rural sites across the country. Quantifying the reductions in major and health harmful air pollutants is crucial for health-related research and for air-quality and climate-change studies.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720331788'),(111,'Science Direct','EN','COVID-19 spike-host cell receptor GRP78 binding site prediction\r\n','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.026','2020','Objectives\r\nUnderstanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives.

CQ and HCQ (CQ/HCQ) inhibit pH-dependent steps of SARS-CoV-2 replication by increasing pH in intracellular vesicles and interfere with virus particle delivery into host cells. Besides direct antiviral effects, CQ/HCQ specifically target extracellular zinc to intracellular lysosomes where it interferes with RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and coronavirus replication. As zinc deficiency frequently occurs in elderly patients and in those with cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, or diabetes, we hypothesize that CQ/HCQ plus zinc supplementation may be more effective in reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality than CQ or HCQ in monotherapy.

Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (-52.68%) and CO (-30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality.

We collected the daily data of new cases in 50 US states between Jan 1–Apr 9, 2020 and also the corresponding weather information (i.e., temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH)). Distribution modeling of new cases across AH and T, helped identify the narrow and vulnerable AH range.

Such patients often experience rapid deterioration and need for mechanical ventilation. Currently, no prospectively validated biomarker of impending respiratory failure is available.\r\n\r\nObjective\r\nWe aimed to identify and prospectively validate biomarkers that allow the identification of patients in need of impending mechanical ventilation.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nPatients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from February 29 to April 9, 2020, were analyzed for baseline clinical and laboratory findings at admission and during the disease. Data from 89 evaluable patients were available for the purpose of analysis comprising an initial evaluation cohort (n = 40) followed by a temporally separated validation cohort (n = 49).\r\n\r\nResults\r\nWe identified markers of inflammation, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine as the variables most predictive of respiratory failure in the evaluation cohort. Maximal IL-6 level before intubation showed the strongest association with the need for mechanical ventilation, followed by maximal CRP level. The respective AUC values for IL-6 and CRP levels in the evaluation cohort were 0.97 and 0.86, and they were similar in the validation cohort (0.90 and 0.83, respectively). The calculated optimal cutoff values during the course of disease from the evaluation cohort (IL-6 level > 80 pg/mL and CRP level > 97 mg/L) both correctly classified 80% of patients in the validation cohort regarding their risk of respiratory failure.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nThe maximal level of IL-6, followed by CRP level, was highly predictive of the need for mechanical ventilation. This suggests the possibility of using IL-6 or CRP level to guide escalation of treatment in patients with COVID-19–related hyperinflammatory syndrome.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920306850'),(148,'Science Direct','EN','El impacto de la pandemia de COVID-19 en la utilización de los servicios urológicos de urgencias','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuro.2020.04.010','2020','Objetivos\r\nComparar el número de pacientes que acuden al servicio de Urología del Centro Hospitalario Universitario de Oporto (CHUP), así como sus características demográficas, los motivos de ingreso, la gravedad clínica según el sistema de triaje de Manchester (MTS) y la necesidad de cirugía de urgencia u hospitalización, durante la pandemia de COVID-19 y el período equivalente en 2019.\r\n\r\nMaterial y métodos\r\nSe recogieron datos de pacientes que acudieron al servicio de urgencias de Urología del CHUP durante 3 semanas —del 11 de marzo de 2020 al 1 de abril de 2020— y del mismo período del año anterior (del 11 de marzo al 1 de abril de 2019).\r\n\r\nResultados\r\nDurante la pandemia, el número de visitas a nuestro servicio de urgencias de Urología se redujo en un 46,4% (122 vs. 263).

The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host. We additionally provide an interactive user-friendly web-application to query the alignment of the 7666 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820301829'),(151,'Science Direct','EN','Emergency tracheal intubation in 202 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: lessons learnt and international expert recommendations','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.03.026','2020','Tracheal intubation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients creates a risk to physiologically compromised patients and to attending healthcare providers.

This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThe authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nWe identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; (2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of “COVID+ units”. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300737'),(153,'Science Direct','ES','Epidemiología de COVID-19 en México: del 27 de febrero al 30 de abril de 2020','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rce.2020.05.007','2020','Antecedentes\r\nEl primer caso de COVID-19 se detectó en México el 27 de febrero de 2020.

Multiple recommendations exist on how radiation oncology practices should deal with this crisis, but little information is available on what actually happens when the COVID-19 surge arrives. New York City experienced the first surge of COVID-19 in the United States and is now the epicenter of the global pandemic. This study reviews how COVID-19 has affected aspects of medicine, nursing, radiation therapy, and administration in a hospital system in New York.\r\n\r\nMethods and Materials\r\nA retrospective review was conducted of the department of radiation oncology in a single health system in New York from March 1, 2020, to April 1, 2020. Collaboration was obtained from physicians, nurses, radiation therapy staff, and administration to recall their policies and effect on specific duties. A timeline was reconstructed to chronicle significant events. Numbers were obtained for patients on treatment, treatment breaks, and COVID-19 infections among staff and patients.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe COVID-19 surge has had a tremendous effect on the health system, such as cessation of all of surgeries, including oncologic surgery, and transfer of all inpatient oncology services to makeshift outpatient facilities. Radiation oncology has made aggressive efforts to reduce the number of patients in treatment to protect patients and staff and to reallocate staff and space for more acute clinical needs. Patients on-beam were reduced by 27% from 172 to 125 by April 1. Almost all visits were changed to telemedicine within 2 weeks. Infection rates and quarantine were quite low among staff and patients. The majority of residents were deployed into COVID-19 clinical settings.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nAlthough we “planned for the worst,” our health system was able to make necessary changes to still function at a reduced capacity.

The World Health Organization defined the subsequent outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide as a public health emergency of international concern. Epidemiological data indicate that at least 20% of COVID-19 patients have severe disease. In addition to impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication. Immune damage mediated by cytokine storms and concomitant AKI is a key factor for poor prognosis. Based on previous experience of blood purification for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome combined with clinical front-line practice, we developed a blood purification protocol for patients with severe COVID-19. This protocol is divided into four major steps. The first step is to assess whether patients with severe COVID-19 require blood purification. The second step is to prescribe a blood purification treatment for patients with COVID-19. The third step is to monitor and adjust parameters of blood purification. The fourth step is to evaluate the timing of discontinuation of blood purification. It is expected that blood purification will play a key role in effectively reducing the mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 through the standardized implementation of the present protocol.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095882X20300372'),(165,'Science Direct','EN','Exploring the Active Compounds of Traditional Mongolian Medicine in Intervention of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Based on Molecular Docking Method','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2020.104016','2020','Objective\r\nThis article intends to use molecular docking technology to find potential inhibitors that can respond to COVID-19 from active compounds in Mongolian medicine.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nMongolian medicine with anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects is selected from Mongolian medicine prescription preparations. TCMSP, ETCM database and document mining methods were used to collect active compounds. Swiss TargetPrediction and SuperPred server were used to find targets of compounds with smiles number. Drugbank and Genecard database were used to collect antiviral drug targets. Then the above targets were compared and analyzed to screen out antiviral targets of Mongolia medicine. Metascape database platform was used to enrich and analyze the GO (Gene ontology) annotation and KEGG pathway of the targets. In view of the high homology of gene sequences between SARS-CoV-2 S-protein RBD domain and SARS virus, as well as their similarities in pathogenesis and clinical manifestations, we established SARS-CoV-2 S-protein model using Swiss-Model. The ZDOCK protein docking software was applied to dock the S-protein with the human angiotensin ACE2 protein to find out the key amino acids of the binding site. Taking ACE2 as the receptor, the molecular docking between the active ingredients and the target protein was studied by AutoDock molecular docking software. The interaction between ligand and receptor is applied to provide a choice for screening anti-COVID-19 drugs.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nA total of 253 active components were predicted. Metascape analysis showed that key candidate targets were significantly enriched in multiple pathways related to different toxins. These key candidate targets were mainly derived from phillyrin and chlorogenic acid. Through the protein docking between S-protein and ACE2, it is found that Glu329/Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2 play an important role in the binding process of the two. The results of molecular docking virtual calculation showed that phillyrin and chlorogenic acid could stably combine with Gln325 and Gln42/Asp38 in ACE2, respectively, which hindered the combination between S- protein and ACE2.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nPhillyrin and chlorogenic acid can effectively prevent the combination of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein and ACE2 at the molecular level.

To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2329050120301005'),(167,'Science Direct','EN','Extensive Partnership, Collaboration, and Teamwork is Required to Stop the COVID-19 Outbreak','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.05.021','2020','The COVID-19 outbreak is a disaster now throughout the world.

Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses. A screening test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed when patients have these extra-respiratory manifestations. In addition, clinicians should be alerted to the adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that can mimic the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens. Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301874'),(169,'Science Direct','ES','Factores asociados a la incidencia y la mortalidad por COVID-19 en las comunidades autónomas','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.05.004','2020','ObjetivoAnalizar la evolución de la epidemia de COVID-19 después del estado de alarma e identificar factores asociados a las diferencias entre las comunidades autónomas.MétodoEstudio ecológico que utilizó variables epidemiológicas, demográficas, ambientales y sobre la estructura de los servicios sanitarios como variables explicativas.

Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics\r\nof both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing\r\nare able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19.\r\nMethods We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the\r\nmodel to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute\r\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number\r\nof initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that\r\ncontacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of\r\nsubclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed\r\ncontrolled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling\r\noutbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure\r\nfeasibility of public health effort.\r\nFindings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset\r\ncould be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak\r\ndecreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom\r\nonset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1·5 were controllable with less\r\nthan 50% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2·5 more than 70% of contacts\r\nhad to be traced, and for an R0 of 3·5 more than 90% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset\r\nand isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1·5. For R0 values\r\nof 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than\r\n1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset.\r\nInterpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new\r\noutbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to\r\nisolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can\r\nbe modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess\r\nthe potential success of local response efforts.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X20300747'),(174,'Science Direct','EN','First known person-to-person transmission of severe acute\r\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the USA','https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30607-3','2020','Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome\r\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019.

However, the environmental consequences associated with the temporary shutdown and recovery of industrial and commercial activities are still not fully understood. Using the well-known carbon footprint (CF) indicator, this paper provides a comprehensive estimation of environmental effects due to the COVID-19 outbreak lockdown measures in Italy. Our aim was to quantify the CF associated with the consumption of energy by any economic activity and region in Italy during the lockdown, and then compare these environmental burdens with the CF calculated for analogous periods from 2015 to 2019 (~March and April). Complementarily, we also conducted a scenario analysis to estimate the post-lockdown CF impact in Italy. A consumption-based approach was applied according to the principles of the established Life Cycle Assessment method. The CF was therefore quantified as a sum of direct and indirect greenhouse gases (GHGs) released from domestically produced and imported energy metabolism flows, excluding the exports. Our findings indicate that the CF in the lockdown period is ~-20% lower than the mean CF calculated for the past. This means avoided GHGs in between ~5.6 and ~10.6 Mt CO2e. Results further suggest that a tendency occurs towards higher impact savings in the Northern regions, on average ~230 kt CO2e of GHGs avoided by province (against ~110–130 kt CO2e in central and Southern provinces). Not surprisingly, these are the utmost industrialized areas of Italy and have been the ones mostly affected by the outbreak. Despite our CF estimates are not free of uncertainties, our research offers quantitative insights to start understanding the magnitude generated by such an exceptional lockdown event in Italy on climate change, and to complement current scientific efforts investigating the relationships between air pollution and the spread of COVID-19.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972033326X'),(205,'Science Direct','EN','Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on clinical practice and training of young gastroenterologists: A European survey','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.05.023','2020','Background\nSARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) is a major challenge for the healthcare system and physicians, imposing changes in daily clinical activity.\n\nAims\nwe aimed to describe what European trainees and young gastroenterologists know about COVID-19 and identify training gaps to implement educational programs.\n\nMethods\nA prospective web-based electronic survey was developed and distributed via e-mail to all members of the Italian Young Gastroenterologist and Endoscopist Association and to European representatives.\n\nResults\nOne hundred and ninety-seven subjects participated in the survey, of whom 14 (7.1%) were excluded.

The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 mortality and severity, and to determine the prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19.\n\nMethods\nWe searched the PubMed for case-control studies in English, published between Jan 1 and Apr 22, 2020, that had data on diabetes in patients with COVID-19. The frequency of diabetes was compared between patients with and without the composite endpoint of mortality or severity. Random effects model was used with odds ratio as the effect size. We also determined the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19. Heterogeneity and publication bias were taken care by meta-regression, sub-group analyses, and trim and fill methods.\n\nResults\nWe included 33 studies (16,003 patients) and found diabetes to be significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.37–2.64; p < 0.01).

At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host’s immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-?B/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-?B p65, p-I?Ba and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of I?Ba. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-?B/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661820311580'),(221,'Science Direct','EN','Lockdown for CoViD-2019 in Milan: What are the effects on air quality?','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139280','2020','Based on the rapid spread of the CoViD-2019, a lockdown was declared in the whole Northern Italy by the Government. The application of increasingly rigorous containment measures allowed to reduce the impact of the CoViD-2019 pandemic on the Italian National Health System but at the same time these restriction measures gave also the opportunity to assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on air pollutants in an unprecedented way. This paper aims to study the impact of the partial and total lockdown (PL and TL, respectively) on air quality in the Metropolitan City of Milan. As results, the severe limitation of people movements following the PL and the subsequent TL determined a significant reduction of pollutants concentration mainly due to vehicular traffic (PM10, PM2.5, BC, benzene, CO, and NOx). The lockdown led to an appreciable drop in SO2 only in the city of Milan while it remained unchanged in the adjacent areas. Despite the significant decrease in NO2 in the TL, the O3 exhibited a significant increase, probably, due to the minor NO concentration. In Milan and SaA the increase was more accentuated, probably, due to the higher average concentrations of benzene in Milan than the adjacent areas that might have promoted the formation of O3 in a more significant way.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720327972'),(222,'Science Direct','EN','Lockdown, one, two, none, or smart.

Increased neutrophil count and neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio were predominant in severe/critical cases or nonsurvivors. During hospitalization, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and platelets showed an increasing trend in survivors, but maintained lower levels or dropped significantly afterwards in nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors kept a high level or showed an upward trend for neutrophils, IL-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer, amyloid A protein, and C-reactive protein, which were kept stable or showed a downward trend in survivors. Positive correlation between CD8+ T-cell and lymphocytes count was found in survivors but not in nonsurvivors.

Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4–8 h to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1–10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ~100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772030596X'),(225,'Science Direct','EN','Lymphopenia is associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections: A systemic review and meta-analysis','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.04.086','2020','Objectives\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new respiratory and systemic disease which needs quick identification of potential critical patients.

La mayoría de las series de casos han reportado alteración en ALT y AST, elevación de bilirrubinas totales y albúmina sérica baja. La afectación hepática se asociado a casos más graves de COVID-19. Por otra parte, se reconoce que la cirrosis hepática es un estado de disfunción inmune que comprende inmunodeficiencia e inflamación sistémica, lo cual hace razonable que estos pacientes sean más susceptibles a la infección por SARS-COV-2. Las recomendaciones para estos pacientes además de las medidas generales para la población (aislamiento social, lavado de manos) incluyen el apoyo social, médico y psicológico durante el periodo de estancia en el domicilio para evitar transgresiones a la terapia.

Expression profiling of 37,846 genes was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12v3 Expression BeadChip. All patients with HCM were genotyped for pathogenic variants causing HCM. Technical validation was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. This study was started on January 1, 1999, and final analysis was completed on April 20, 2020.\n\nResults\nOverall, 22% of the transcriptome (8443 of 37,846 genes) was expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Analysis by genotype revealed that gene expression changes were similar among genotypic subgroups of HCM, with only 4% (1502 of 37,846) to 6% (2336 of 37,846) of the transcriptome exhibiting differential expression between genotypic subgroups. The qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression in 92% (11 of 12 genes) of tested transcripts. Notably, in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transcript for angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change, 3.53; q-value =1.30×10-23), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold change, 3.78; P=5.22×10-4), and Western blot confirmed greater than 5-fold overexpression of ACE2 protein (fold change, 5.34; P=1.66×10-6).\n\nConclusion\nMore than 20% of the transcriptome is expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Importantly, ACE2 was the most up-regulated gene in HCM, indicating perhaps the heart’s compensatory effort to mount an antihypertrophic, antifibrotic response. However, given that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620303980'),(232,'Science Direct','EN','Maternal death due to COVID-19','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.04.030','2020','Despite 2.5 million infections and 169,000 deaths worldwide (as of April 20, 2020), no maternal deaths and only a few pregnant women afflicted with severe respiratory morbidity have been reported to be related to COVID-19 disease.

The usefulness of existing approaches for re-purposing range from computational modeling to clinical trials. These are often time-consuming, resource intensive, and prone to failure. Proposed here is a new but simple concept that would capitalize on the opportunity presented by the on-going natural experiment involving the collection of data from epidemiological surveillance screening and diagnostic testing for clinical treatment. The objective would be to also collect for each Covid-19 case the patient\'s prior usage of existing therapeutic drugs. These drug usage data would be collected for several major test groups - those who test positive for active SARS-CoV-2 infection (using molecular methods) and those who test negative for current infection but also test positive for past infection (using serologic antibody tests). Patients from each of these groups would also be categorized with respect to where they resided on the spectrum of morbidities (from no or mild symptomology to severe). By comparing the distribution of normalized usage data for each drug within each group, drugs that are more associated with particular test groups could be revealed as having potential prophylactic, therapeutic, or contraindicated effects with respect to disease progression. These drugs could then be selected as candidates for further evaluation in fighting Covid-19. Also summarized are some of the numerous attributes, advantages, and limitations of the proposed concept, all pointing to the need for further discussion and evaluation.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590113320300109'),(236,'Science Direct','EN','Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak: Perspectives from the radiation oncology service in Singapore','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2020.03.030','2020','In December 2019, pneumonia of unknown cause was reported by China to WHO.

We aimed to assess the incidence and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in an urban region during the pandemic, compared with non-pandemic periods.\n\nMethods\nWe did a population-based, observational study using data for non-traumatic OHCA (N=30?768), systematically collected since May 15, 2011, in Paris and its suburbs, France, using the Paris Fire Brigade database, together with in-hospital data. We evaluated OHCA incidence and outcomes over a 6-week period during the pandemic in adult inhabitants of the study area.\n\nFindings\nComparing the 521 OHCAs of the pandemic period (March 16 to April 26, 2020) to the mean of the 3052 total of the same weeks in the non-pandemic period (weeks 12–17, 2012–19), the maximum weekly OHCA incidence increased from 13·42 (95% CI 12·77–14·07) to 26·64 (25·72–27·53) per million inhabitants (p<0·0001), before returning to normal in the final weeks of the pandemic period. Although patient demographics did not change substantially during the pandemic compared with the non-pandemic period (mean age 69·7 years [SD 17] vs 68·5 [18], 334 males [64·4%] vs 1826 [59·9%]), there was a higher rate of OHCA at home (460 [90·2%] vs 2336 [76·8%]; p<0·0001), less bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (239 [47·8%] vs 1165 [63·9%]; p<0·0001) and shockable rhythm (46 [9·2%] vs 472 [19·1%]; p<0·0001), and longer delays to intervention (median 10·4 min [IQR 8·4–13·8] vs 9·4 min [7·9–12·6]; p<0·0001). The proportion of patients who had an OHCA and were admitted alive decreased from 22·8% to 12·8% (p<0·0001) in the pandemic period. After adjustment for potential confounders, the pandemic period remained significantly associated with lower survival rate at hospital admission (odds ratio 0·36, 95% CI 0·24–0·52; p<0·0001). COVID-19 infection, confirmed or suspected, accounted for approximately a third of the increase in OHCA incidence during the pandemic.\n\nInterpretation\nA transient two-times increase in OHCA incidence, coupled with a reduction in survival, was observed during the specified time period of the pandemic when compared with the equivalent time period in previous years with no pandemic. Although this result might be partly related to COVID-19 infections, indirect effects associated with lockdown and adjustment of health-care services to the pandemic are probable. Therefore, these factors should be taken into account when considering mortality data and public health strategies.\n\nFunding\nThe French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM)','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468266720301171'),(249,'Science Direct','EN','Pancreatic Injury Patterns in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 19 Pneumonia','https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2020.03.055','2020','Since December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19)\noccurred in Wuhan, and rapidly spread throughout China.1 Recent studies mainly focused\non the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed infection.1-3\nLittle attention has been paid to the pancreatic injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508520304091'),(250,'Science Direct','EN','Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacies for COVID-19','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.05.009','2020','Background\nCommunity pharmacies provide an important healthcare service, which is broadly established, and constitutes the preferred and initial contact for members of the community. The significant value of community pharmacies was further highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.\n\nObjective\nThe assessment of community pharmacies preparedness for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional interview survey of 1018 community pharmacies working in four regions of Egypt (South, East, Centre, and North). Data collection was conducted from 8–19 April 2020.\n\nResults\nAvailability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medication was better than alcohol (70% conc.). Home delivery services were available in 49.1% of pharmacies. Infection control measures covering interactions between staff were in place in up to 99.5% of pharmacies. Conversely, there was less frequent availability of contactless payment (29.1%), hand sanitizers (62.1%) or masks (86.5%) for customer use, or a separate area for patients with suspected COVID-19 (64%). Verbal customer education (90.4%) was used preferably to written (81.3%). Despite high clinical knowledge and awareness (97.6%–99.2%), only 8.8% of pharmacists had reported suspected COVID-19 cases, however this varied significantly with pharmacist demographics (geographic region P < 0.001; pandemic training p < 0.001; position p = 0.019; age p = 0.046).\n\nConclusions\nGovernment and policymakers strive to mitigate the shortage of PPE and medication. More attention should be given to infection control measures around interactions between staff and customers to ensure community pharmacists are fit and able to provide continuity in their important role. Educating customers using regularly-updated posters, banners or signs will contribute to decreasing contact with patients, and reducing the number and duration of visits to the pharmacy. Pandemic preparedness of community pharmacists must also extend to reporting procedures. By avoiding under-reporting or over-reporting, community pharmacists will contribute to accurate monitoring of the national spread of infection.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551741120305015'),(251,'Science Direct','FR','Panique et pandémie : revue de la littérature sur les liens entre le trouble panique et l’épidémie à SARS-CoV-2Panic and pandemic: Review of the literature on the links between panic disorder and the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010','2020','L’état de panique associé à la pandémie liée au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite à s’interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait générer ou aggraver.

Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventative mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nObjective\nThe aim of the present study is to examine the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China.\n\nStudy Design\nA multi-center cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the announcement of the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1 to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020 when the coronavirus epidemic was publically announced and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended EPDS was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre and post study groups.\n\nResults\nPregnant women assessed after the declaration of COVID-19 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=0.02) than women assess pre-epidemic announcement. These women were also more likely to endorse thoughts of self-harm (P=0.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases (P=0.003), suspected infections (P=0.004), and death cases per day (P=0.001). Pregnant women who were underweight pre-pregnancy, primiparous, < 35 years old, employed full-time, middle income, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk to develop depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.\n\nConclusion\nMajor life-threatening public health events such as the COVID-19 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937820305342'),(254,'Science Direct','EN','Pernio-like skin lesions associated with COVID-19: a case series of 318 patients from 8 countries','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.05.109','2020','Background\nIncreasing evidence suggests pernio-like lesions are cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.\n\nObjective\nTo describe clinical and pathologic findings of pernio-like lesions in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.\n\nMethods\nAn international dermatology registry was circulated to healthcare providers worldwide through the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), International League of Dermatologic Societies (ILDS), and other organizations.\n\nResults\nWe documented 505 patients with dermatologic manifestations associated with COVID-19, including 318 (63%) with pernio-like lesions. Patients with pernio-like lesions were generally young and healthy, with relatively mild COVID-19.

Responses were stratified by practice type: ambulatory surgery center (ASC) or hospital-based.\n\nResults\nIn total, 123 practices (55% ASC-based and 45% hospital-based) responded. At the pandemic’s peak (as reported by the respondent), practices saw a 90% drop in endoscopy volume with most centers planning to resume elective endoscopy a median of 55 days after initial restrictions. Declining community prevalence of COVID-19, PPE availability, and pre-procedure SARS-CoV-2 testing availability were ranked as the three primary factors influencing reactivation timing. ASC-based practices were more likely to identify pre-procedure testing availability as a major factor limiting elective endoscopy resumption (p=0.001).

In this paper, we have used data-driven estimation methods like long short-term memory (LSTM) and curve fitting for prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases in India 30 days ahead and effect of preventive measures like social isolation and lockdown on the spread of COVID-19. The prediction of various parameters (number of positive cases, number of recovered cases, etc.) obtained by the proposed method is accurate within a certain range and will be a beneficial tool for administrators and health officials.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720322798'),(267,'Science Direct','EN','Preparedness and response to Pediatric CoVID-19 in European Emergency Departments: a survey of the REPEM and PERUKI networks','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2020.05.018','2020','Study objective\nWe aimed to describe the variability and identify gaps in preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic in European EDs caring for children.\n\nMethods\nA cross-sectional point prevalence survey, was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (REPEM) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (PERUKI). We aimed to include ten EDs for countries with > 20 million inhabitants and five EDs for less populated countries, unless the number of eligible EDs was below five. ED directors or their delegates completed the survey between March 20th and 21st to report practice at that time. We used descriptive statistics to analyse data.\n\nResults\nOverall 102 centers from 18 countries (86% response rate) completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on PPE items was shown for recommended PPE use at pre-triage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items, most frequently FFP2/N95 masks. Only 17% of EDs had negative pressure isolation rooms.

It enables to allocate scarce resources in priority to those with the highest probability of benefiting from them. It is fully ethical provided it relies on objective and widely shared criteria, thus preventing arbitrary decisions and guaranteeing equity. Prioritisation seeks to fairly allocate treatments, maximise saved lives, gain indirect life benefits from prioritising exposed healthcare and similar workers, give priority to those most penalised as a last resort, and apply similar prioritisation schemes to all patients.\n\nPrioritisation strategy\nPrioritisation schemes and their criteria are adjusted to the level of resource scarcity: strain (level A) or saturation (level B). Prioritisation yields a four level priority for initiation or continuation of critical care: P1–high priority, P2–intermediate priority, P3–not needed, P4–not appropriate. Prioritisation schemes take into account the patient\'s wishes, clinical frailty, pre-existing chronic condition, along with severity and evolution of acute condition. Initial priority level must be reassessed, at least after 48 h once missing decision elements are available, at the typical turning point in the disease\'s natural history (ICU days 7 to 10 for COVID-19), and each time resource scarcity levels change. For treatments to be withheld or withdrawn, a collegial decision-making process and information of patient and/or next of kin are paramount.\n\nPerspective\nPrioritisation strategy is bound to evolve with new knowledge and with changes within the epidemiological situation.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352556820300916'),(273,'Science Direct','FR','Prisons confinées : quelles conséquences pour les soins psychiatriques et la santé mentale des personnes détenues en France ?','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002','2020','Objectif\nEn France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues.\n\nMéthode\nCe travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée.\n\nRésultats\nL’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge.\n\nDiscussion\nLes remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire.

This study aimed to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with lung cancer in China.\n\nMethods\nWe collected data on 397 inpatients from a single center during 4 weeks of the epidemic time (2020 group), and that of 2504 inpatients during the same period (4 weeks) in last 5 years (2015-2019 group). A questionnaire was used to investigate medical demands among 803 patients with lung cancer at 65 hospitals from 20 provinces in China during the epidemic. We evaluate the incidence data of COVID-19 in Guangdong to analyze the tendency of the pandemic and compared it with inpatient data.\n\nResults\nThe number of hospitalizations and lung cancer-related surgeries had steadily increased in 2015-2019 but reduced by an average of 26.72% (133.8) and 57.18% (45.4) in 2020. The hospital capacity decreased by 28.00% (35 inpatient beds) during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period. The epidemic caused a greater impact on medical work related to lung cancer after the Chinese New Year holiday. Patients were most concerned about longer waiting time for outpatient services, inpatient beds, physical examinations, or surgeries (406; 50.56%), the possibility of infection with the novel coronavirus (359; 44.71%), difficulties in getting to a hospital due to transportation outages (279; 34.74%). Patients in stage I and II showed less fear about disease progression (14, 18.18%; 4, 14.81%), lower proportions of delayed medical arrangement (15, 19.48%; 6, 22.22%) and less complain about complex treatment procedures (12, 15.58%, 5, 18.52%).

If the diagnosis remains uncertain, an endomyocardial biopsy may help identify active cardiac infection through viral genome amplification and possibly refine the treatment risks of systemic immunosuppression. Arrhythmias are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients, but the pathophysiology is still speculative. Nevertheless, clinicians should be vigilant to provide prompt monitoring and treatment. The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis, including the majority of mild cases, remains unknown.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1547527120304227'),(285,'Science Direct','ES','Recomendaciones de consenso SEDAR-SEMICYUC sobre el manejo de las alteraciones de la hemostasia en los pacientes graves con infección por COVID-19','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.05.007','2020','La infección por el coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, causante de la enfermedad denominada COVID-19, provoca alteraciones fundamentalmente en el sistema respiratorio.

Orthopedic surgery has not been spared from these effects, with the postponement of elective procedures in an attempt to mitigate disease transmission and preserve hospital resources as the pandemic continues to expand. During these turbulent times, it is crucial to understand that although patients’ and care-providers’ safety is paramount, canceling or postponing essential surgical care is not without consequences and may be irreversibly detrimental to patients’ health and quality of life in some cases. The optimal solution to how to balance effectively the resumption of standard surgical care while doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 is undetermined and could include such strategies as social distancing, screening forms and tests, including temperature screening, segregation of inpatient and outpatient teams, proper use of protective gear, and the use of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) to provide elective, yet ultimately essential, surgical care while conserving resources and protecting the health of patients and health care providers.

Newer randomized controlled studies that have recently become available, showed a mixed result. We aimed to systematically search the literature to understand the pharmacology and clinical effects of remdesivir in patients with COVID-19.\n\nMethods\nWe systematically searched the PubMed, ClinicalTrial.Org and MedRxiv database up till May 5, 2020 using specific key words such as “Remdesivir” or ‘GS-5734?

Currently, detailed pathologic examination of kidney damage in critically ill patients with COVID-19 has been lacking. To help define this we analyzed kidney abnormalities in 26 autopsies of patients with COVID-19 by light microscopy, ultrastructural observation and immunostaining. Patients were on average 69 years (19 male and 7 female) with respiratory failure associated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome as the cause of death. Nine of the 26 showed clinical signs of kidney injury that included increased serum creatinine and/or new-onset proteinuria. By light microscopy, diffuse proximal tubule injury with the loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and even frank necrosis was observed. Occasional hemosiderin granules and pigmented casts were identified. There were prominent erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material. Evidence of vasculitis, interstitial inflammation or hemorrhage was absent. Electron microscopic examination showed clusters of coronavirus-like particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium and podocytes. Furthermore, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 was found to be upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and immunostaining with SARS-CoV nucleoprotein antibody was positive in tubules. In addition to the direct virulence of SARS-CoV-2, factors contributing to acute kidney injury included systemic hypoxia, abnormal coagulation, and possible drug or hyperventilation-relevant rhabdomyolysis. Thus, our studies provide direct evidence of the invasion of SARSCoV-2 into kidney tissue. These findings will greatly add to the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253820303690'),(294,'Science Direct','EN','Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and COVID-19 infection','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ando.2020.04.005','2020','With the multiplication of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome cases due to SARS-COV2, some concerns about angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have emerged. Since the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to up-regulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003426620300627'),(295,'Science Direct','FR','Repositionnement de la chlorpromazine dans le traitement du COVID-19 : étude reCoVery','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.010','2020','Objectifs\nLa pandémie mondiale actuelle de COVID-19 a touché environ 2 350 000 personnes et fait plus de 160 000 morts.

Cette hypothèse est cohérente avec les propriétés antivirales connues de la CPZ. En plus de ses effets antipsychotiques classiques, plusieurs études in vitro ont également démontré une activité antivirale de cette phénothiazine via l’inhibition de l’endocytose dépendante des clathrines.

Potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 were analyzed by a multivariable binary logistic model. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in severe patients.\n\nResults\nWe identified 269 (49.1%) of 548 patients as severe cases on admission. Older age, underlying hypertension, high cytokine levels (IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a), and high lactate dehydrogenase level were significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on admission. The prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan.

We aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored COVID-19 vaccine expressing the spike glycoprotein of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain.\n\nMethods\nWe did a dose-escalation, single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, phase 1 trial of an Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine in Wuhan, China. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 60 years were sequentially enrolled and allocated to one of three dose groups (5?×?1010, 1?×?1011, and 1·5?×?1011 viral particles) to receive an intramuscular injection of vaccine. The primary outcome was adverse events in the 7 days post-vaccination. Safety was assessed over 28 days post-vaccination. Specific antibodies were measured with ELISA, and the neutralising antibody responses induced by vaccination were detected with SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralisation and pseudovirus neutralisation tests. T-cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and flow-cytometry assays. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04313127.\n\nFindings\nBetween March 16 and March 27, 2020, we screened 195 individuals for eligibility. Of them, 108 participants (51% male, 49% female; mean age 36·3 years) were recruited and received the low dose (n=36), middle dose (n=36), or high dose (n=36) of the vaccine. All enrolled participants were included in the analysis. At least one adverse reaction within the first 7 days after the vaccination was reported in 30 (83%) participants in the low dose group, 30 (83%) participants in the middle dose group, and 27 (75%) participants in the high dose group. The most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients, and the most commonly reported systematic adverse reactions were fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]), and muscle pain (18 [17%]. Most adverse reactions that were reported in all dose groups were mild or moderate in severity. No serious adverse event was noted within 28 days post-vaccination. ELISA antibodies and neutralising antibodies increased significantly at day 14, and peaked 28 days post-vaccination. Specific T-cell response peaked at day 14 post-vaccination.\n\nInterpretation\nThe Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine is tolerable and immunogenic at 28 days post-vaccination. Humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were noted from day 14 post-vaccination. Our findings suggest that the Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine warrants further investigation.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673620312083'),(306,'Science Direct','EN','Saliva is a reliable tool to detect SARS-CoV-2','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.04.005','2020','Objectives\nThis study analyzed salivary samples of COVID-19 patients and compared the results with their clinical and laboratory data.\n\nMethods\nSalivary samples of 25 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by rRT-PCR.

It is expected that rationing of surgical resources will continue even after the pandemic peak and may recur with future pandemics, creating a need for a means of triaging patients for emergent and elective spine surgery.\n\nMethods\nUsing a modified Delphi technique, a cohort of 16 fellowship-trained spine surgeons from 10 academic medical centers constructed a scoring system for the triage and prioritization of emergent and elective spine surgeries. Three separate rounds of videoconferencing and written correspondence were used to reach a final scoring system. Sixteen test cases were used to optimize the scoring system so that it could categorize cases as requiring emergent, urgent, high-priority elective, or low-priority elective scheduling.\n\nResults\nThe devised scoring system included 8 independent components: neurologic status, underlying spine stability, presentation of a high-risk postoperative complication, patient medical comorbidities, expected hospital course, expected discharge disposition, facility resource limitations, and local disease burden.

Although blood increased concentrations of Se can be achieved with various pharmacological preparations, only one chemical form (sodium selenite) can offer a true protection. Sodium selenite, but not selenate, can oxidize thiol groups in the virus protein disulfide isomerase rendering it unable to penetrate the healthy cell membrane.

What is now known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread widely since then and, as of this writing, has infected over 1.8 million people worldwide and has claimed the lives of over 100,000 patients [1]. The disease, COVID-19, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 has many similarities to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), both of which have also been fatal [2].

Thus, there is an immense need for treatment strategies to help combat this contagious disease. In previous studies, severe patients that have been hospitalized for COVID-19 have had laboratory results that show an increased level of cytokines, specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6) [3]. This increase may be attributed to the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that is triggered by a variety of factors such as infections [4]. Since IL-6 plays an important role in CRS, it serves as a possible mechanism of treatment in severe patients.

Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whether myocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19.\n\nMethods\nWe enrolled patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 retrospectively and collected heart-related clinical data, mainly including cardiac imaging findings, laboratory results and clinical outcomes. Serial tests of cardiac markers were traced for the analysis of potential myocardial injury/myocarditis.\n\nResults\n112 COVID-19 patients were enrolled in our study. There was evidence of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients and 14 (12.5%) patients had presented abnormalities similar to myocarditis.

While there are no practice guidelines specific to AYA telemedicine, observations made during this implementation can highlight challenges encountered and suggest solutions to some of these challenges.\n\nMethods\nOver the course of several weeks in March, 2020, the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Clinic at the University of California San Francisco rapidly replaced most in-person visits with telemedicine visits. This required logistical problem-solving, collaboration of all clinic staff members, and continuous reassessment of clinical practices. This article describes observations made during these processes.\n\nResults\nTelemedicine visits increased from zero to 97% of patient encounters in one month. The number of visits per month was comparable with that one year prior. While there were limitations to the clinic’s ability to carry out health supervision visits, many general health, mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction treatment services were implemented via telemedicine. Providers identified creative solutions for challenges that arose to managing general confidentiality issues as well as specific challenges related to mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction care.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world.\n\nMethods\nTo examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April).\n\nFindings\nOur projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66–97) and 24% (13–90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.\n\nInterpretation\nRestrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.\n\nFunding\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation, National Institute for Health Research, Wellcome Trust, and Health Data Research UK.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468266720300736'),(339,'Science Direct','EN','The epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105955','2020','In December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China spread worldwide, becoming an emergency of major international concern.

Nineteen patients (48 %) were associated with a family cluster outbreak. Seventeen patients (52 %) had traveled or lived in Hubei Province. These patients are early mild cases, most common symptoms are fever [23 (70 %)] and cough [13 (39 %)]. Most patients\' white blood cell counts are normal, while they manifest as significant reduction in lymphocytes [17/28 (61 %)]. The levels of c-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest a typical viral infection. Procalcitonin did not increase and D-dimer increased slightly. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have elevated in most patients. CT images of these patients showed bilateral multiple plaques or nodular ground-glass opacities (68.4 %). Fecal nucleic acid results were positive in eight COVID-19 patients accompanied with diarrhea. Tear nucleic acid results were negative in six COVID-19 patients. And four asymptomatic patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nConclusions\nThe clinical symptoms, laboratory results and imaging reports of patients with COVID-19 in Hunan area are significantly different from those in Wuhan area. For non-Wuhan epidemic areas, more attention should be paid to nucleic acid test results of throat swabs and stools, and it is not easily to diagnose based on clinical symptoms and CT results. Reduced whole blood lymph count can be used as an adjuvant diagnosis of early SARS-CoV-2 infection. Attention should be paid to asymptomatic carriers, which is of great significance for the control of the global epidemic.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301396'),(347,'Science Direct','EN','The MERS-CoV Receptor DPP4 as a Candidate Binding Target of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2020.101160','2020','The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 has caused great number of cases and deaths, but our understanding about the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear.

At present, there is no specific antiviral drug or vaccine for COVID-19. The pathogenic infectivity of the virus requires the S1 subunit of the spike (S) protein to bind the host cell receptor, angiontensin converting enzyme (ACE2). While the binding to host cell receptor is the first step of infection, the entrance of the virus into the cell needs the cleavage of S1–S2 subunits to expose S2 for fusion to cell membrane via host proteases including cathepsins, cell surface transmembrane protease/serine (TMPRSS) proteases, furin, trypsin and factor Xa. Previous in vitro studies have shown that factor Xa inhibition can decrease viral infectivity. We suppose that host cell proteases including furin (as expressed highly in lungs), factor Xa and cathepsin are possible targets to decrease viral burden, therefore unfractioned heparin and low molecular weight heparin-LMWH (specifically dalteparin and tinzaparin for their anti inflammatory action) can be potential inhibitors of multiple endoproteases involved in virus infectivity. Our hypothesis needs to be tested in in vitro and clinical studies, however as we are in an urgent situation as the burden of SARS-CoV2 is increasing all around the world, we recommend the usage of unfractioned heparin or LMWH in intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients with the risk–benefit judgement of the clinician.

Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95?°C and mean precipitation around 8.74?mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57?°C and 20.87?mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65?°C and 8.48?mm respectively).

In particular, the province of Bergamo has reported to date\n6471 positive nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in a population of 1.114.590 inhabitants, and is therefore the province\nwith the highest rate of infection per 100.000 inhabitants worldwide2\n(http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/). A recent publication by the IBD Elite Union, which incorporates the\nseven largest Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) referral centers in China, with more than 20.000 patients with IBD,\nreported no cases of COVID-19. This report included the three largest tertiary IBD centers in Wuhan (Tongji Hospital, Union\nHospital, and Zhongnan Hospital) dating March 8th 3.\nHowever, there is still uncertainty as to whether patients with IBD are more susceptible to COVID-19. To date, several\nstrategies have been introduced in China to better manage IBD patients during the Chinese outbreak of SARS-CoV-2\n(https://ecco-ibd.eu/images/6_Publication/6_8_Surveys/2nd_Interview_COVID-19_ECCO_Taskforce_published.pdf ).\nThe aim of this communication is to report the experience of our IBD centre during the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 in an area\nof high prevalence of the infection in Italy','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508520304455'),(365,'Science Direct','EN','Universal testing of patients and their support persons for COVID-19 when presenting for admission to Labor and Delivery within the Mount Sinai Health System','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100147','2020','The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS CoV-2) virus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) (1). It spread at an accelerated rate in densely populated regions such as NYC which is considered an epicenter.\nWithin the Mount Sinai Health System, we began to care for pregnant women with COVID -19 in\nMarch of 2020. In April 2020 a policy was implemented to perform universal SARS-CoV 2 testing for\nwomen planning to deliver within the Mount Sinai Health system, as well as their designated support\npersons so as to inform obstetric and neonatal practices.\nDuring the testing interval of April 4- 15, 2020, 307 asymptomatic women presenting in labor to\ntwo institutions within Mount Sinai Health System, underwent SARS-CoV 2 testing. Among the 307\nwomen tested, 50 SARS CoV-2 infections were detected. The prevalence of asymptomatic infection in\nthis group was 50/307 (16.3%). Among these women 91 did not have a support person present. Of the\nremaining 216 support persons 17 declined testing leaving 199 available for testing. All support persons\nwere administered an infectious screening tool upon entry and all screened negative (2). Of these 199\nsupport persons who underwent SARS-CoV 2 testing 39 were infected with a prevalence of 19.6%\n(39/199).\nWe explored concordance/discordance rates between patients and support persons. Among\nSARS-CoV 2 infected patients, 23/28 (82.1%) support persons were infected. However only 16/171 \n(9.4%) support persons were infected when patients tested negative. Importantly COVID negative\npatients had COVID positive support persons 6.2% of the time. (Table 1) Comparing positive to negative\npatients, this corresponds to a difference in the risk of the support person being positive of 72.8 (95% CI:\n57.9, 87.6) and a relative risk of 8.8 (95% CI: 5.3, 14.4).\nBased on these findings, it is apparent that there was a high proportion of asymptomatic COVID34 19 infected patients and support persons at the height of the pandemic in N.Y.C hospitals. Our data\nsuggests that universal testing of patients and support persons may direct use of PPE and more\nadequately protect health care workers. Testing of support persons may also impact newborn care\nprecautions. Additionally, the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing informs how patients are cohorted on\npostpartum units offering protection to uninfected women and newborns. Given the high rate of\nasymptomatic infected maternity patients and support persons, universal testing provides enhanced\nsafety for all.

Among coronaviruses, the main protease (Mpro) is an essential drug target which, along with papain-like proteases catalyzes the processing of polyproteins translated from viral RNA and recognizes specific cleavage sites. There are no human proteases with similar cleavage specificity and therefore, inhibitors are highly likely to be nontoxic. Therefore, targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme with small molecules can block viral replication. The present study is aimed at the identification of promising lead molecules for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme through virtual screening of antiviral compounds from plants. The binding affinity of selected small drug-like molecules to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro were studied using molecular docking. Bonducellpin D was identified as the best lead molecule which shows higher binding affinity (-9.28 kcal/mol) as compared to the control (-8.24 kcal/mol). The molecular binding was stabilized through four hydrogen bonds with Glu166 and Thr190 as well as hydrophobic interactions via eight residues. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro shows identities of 96.08% and 50.65% to that of SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro respectively at the sequence level. At the structural level, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and SARS-CoV Mpro was found to be 0.517 Å and 0.817 Å between SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro. Bonducellpin D exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition potential against SARS-CoV Mpro and MERS-CoV Mpro and therefore is a promising drug candidate, which needs further validations through in vitro and in vivo studies.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520305816'),(367,'Science Direct','EN','Using observational data to quantify bias of traveller-derived COVID-19 prevalence estimates in Wuhan, China','https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30229-2','2020','The incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, has been estimated using imported case counts of international travellers, generally under the assumptions that all cases of the disease in travellers have been ascertained and that infection prevalence in travellers and residents is the same.

Data of 2020 were compared with those of the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with those of the other 9 provinces. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlations between the SV of COVID-19 and the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases were analyzed. The lag effects were discussed.\n\nResults\nComparing the SV from January 1, 2020 to February 20, 2020 with those for the same period of the previous three years, Hubei\'s SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea, and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P<0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases (rconfirmed = 0.723, rsuspected = 0.863, both p < 0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who searched relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see doctors in 2–3 days later and be confirmed in 3–4 days later.\n\nConclusion\nThe total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warned us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of the lower respiratory tract but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. Internet search behavior had a positive correlation with the number of newly confirmed/suspected cases, suggesting that big data has an important role in the early warning of infectious diseases.','https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095881120300639'),(369,'Science Direct','EN','Validation of predictors of disease severity and outcomes in COVID-19 patients: a descriptive and retrospective study','https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medj.2020.05.002','2020','Background\nThe severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases has been associated with percentage of circulating lymphocytes (LYM%), levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), lactic acid (LA) and viral load (ORF1ab Ct). However, the predictive power of each of these indicators in disease classification and prognosis remains largely unclear.\n\nMethods\nwe retrospectively collected information on the above parameters in 142 patients with COVID-19, stratifying them by survival or disease severity.\n\nFindings\nCRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM% and ORF1ab Ct were significantly altered between survivors and non-survivors. LYM%, CRP and IL-6 were the most sensitive and reliable factors in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors. These indicators were significantly different between critically ill and severe/moderate patients. Only LYM% levels were significantly different between severe and moderate types. Among all the investigated indicators, LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable in discriminating between critically ill, severe and moderate types, and between survivors and non-survivors.\n\nConclusions\nCRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM% and ORF1ab Ct, but not LA, could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients.
